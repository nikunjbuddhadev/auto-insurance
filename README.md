# auto-insurance
Dataset contains past/ existing customer data of an auto-insurance company. Auto insurance policies were sold to these customers in past. Now, insurance company wants to predict which new customers should be sent marketing promotions (for selling policies) so that responses are likely to happen.   

We start by importing the dataset then by reading it and pre - processing it. We then split the dataset into train and test sets. Then we create our base model with decision tree. After this we balanced our data with Random OverSampling Examples (ROSE).  We also made xgboost model for this data. For feature engineering we apply PCA to the data and to this dimensionally reduced data and we check the accuracy and quality of these models by confusion matrix and ROC plot.  

R As usual, we will first download our datasets locally, and then we will load them into data frames in both, R . Source of dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing In R, we use read.csv to read CSV files into data.frame variables. Although the R function read.csv can work with URLs, https is a problem for R in many cases, so you need to use a package like RCurl to get around it. Libraries used : 1)library(readxl) #to read .xlsv file . 2)library(caTools) #for sample.split . 3)library(rpart) #for prediction() , performance() . 4)library(rpart.plot) #for plotting ROC curve . 5)library(ROSE) #for applying ROSE . 6)library(xgboost) #for applying XGboost.
